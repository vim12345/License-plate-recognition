# License-plate-recognition

# Description:
License Plate Recognition (LPR) involves detecting and extracting text from vehicle license plates. It's widely used in traffic monitoring, toll systems, parking access, and law enforcement. This project combines object detection (to locate the plate) and OCR (to read the characters). We'll use OpenCV for plate detection and Tesseract OCR to extract the plate number.

# What It Does:
This project detects the license plate area in an image and reads the plate number using OCR. It's a mini version of an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system, useful for smart parking, highway tolls, security checkpoints, and urban traffic systems.
